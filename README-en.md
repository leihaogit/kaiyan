## Project Introduction
The project imitates the [Eyepetizer app][18], which mainly involves video playback, page loading, database management, and more. The main purpose of doing this project is to improve one's proficiency in Kotlin and JetPack. The application interface is simple, and the code is relatively easy to understand. The coding should refer to the [official Kotlin documentation][1] as much as possible. If the source code of the project is helpful to you, **Star** can support it. Thank you very much! In addition, if you are interested in this project, please participate in discussions and contribute code to jointly promote the development and improvement of the project!
